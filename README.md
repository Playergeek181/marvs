# Introduction

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate academic assignment. The objective was to design a robotic manipulator to address a problem of the students' choosing, applying the concepts learned throughout the course.

The MARVS project is a robotic manipulator designed for planting small plants in remote areas via an autonomous robot. See more about the project on the [wiki](https://github.com/Playergeek181/marvs/wiki)
